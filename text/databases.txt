## What is a Database
- Database is a collection of organized data that can be easily accessed and managed

- Instead we make use of a software referred to as a Database Management Systems(DBMS)

## Popular DBMS

### Relational
   - MYSQL
   - POSTGRESQL
   - ORACLE
   - SQL server

### NoSQL

   - DynamoDB
   - ORACLE
   - SQL SERVER

## Relational Database & SQL

- Structured Query Language(SQL) - Language used to communicate with DBMS

## Postgres

- Each instance of postgres can be carved into multiple separate databases

- By default every Postgres installation comes with one database already created called "postgres"
- This is important because Postgres requires you to specify the name of a database to make a connection. So there needs to always be one database

## Tables
- A table represents a subject or event in an application
- A table is made up of columns and rows
- Each Column represents a different attribute
- Each row represents a different entry in the table
